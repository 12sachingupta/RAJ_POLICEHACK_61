Detect and combat the rising threat of deep fake content with our Deep Fake Detection Framework. This open-source project is designed to empower developers, researchers, and organizations in identifying manipulated media content using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Detection:** Robust detection capabilities across visual (image and video) and auditory (speech and audio) modalities.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Swift identification of deep fake content in real-time scenarios, including live streaming and video conferencing.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Continuous learning and adaptation to evolving deep fake generation techniques.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy integration into existing applications and platforms with a clean and customizable interface.
- **Scalability:** Efficient deep fake detection across a range of devices, from edge devices to cloud servers.

## Getting Started

Follow our comprehensive [documentation](link-to-docs) to quickly integrate the Deep Fake Detection Framework into your project. Get started with minimal setup and start safeguarding against the perils of manipulated media content.

## Installation

```bash
pip install deepfake-detection
```

## Usage

```python
from deepfake_detection import DeepFakeDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = DeepFakeDetector()

# Load an image or video for analysis
media_content = "path/to/your/content.mp4"
result = detector.detect(media_content)

# Analyze the result
if result["is_deepfake"]:
    print("Deep fake detected!")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}%")
else:
    print("No deep fake detected.")
```
